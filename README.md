**TIPS:**
- You can create a shortcut to the .exe file to access it more easily
- You can delete assets.bat and this file after installation
- Don't move the "assets" folder or "MyHud.exe" and dont change any Files (Unless you know what you doing)
- You can edit the text in the upper right corner by writing in the "assets/Your_Motivation_Text/motivation.txt" file
- For the GIF display, you can also use .png and .jpg files, just put them in the "asstes/Your_Gifs" folder
